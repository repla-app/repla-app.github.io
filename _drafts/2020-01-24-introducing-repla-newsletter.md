This is the first newsletter for Repla, a new macOS app for developers. Besides the name change, the big news is that the first version of Repla is [available to download](https://repla.app/) now as a public alpha.

This version focuses on Repla Server, an easy way for web developers to run a local web server that refreshes automatically. You can read more about it on [our website](https://repla.app/).

We're still working on our [live coding features](https://repla.app/plugins/live-coding/). We've also published a couple of blog posts that share some details about [how Repla was designed](https://blog.repla.app/2020/01/13/what-is-repla/), and [explore some other use cases](https://blog.repla.app/2020/01/13/repla-use-cases/).

Thank you for your support, and till next time!
