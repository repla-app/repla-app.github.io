Repla now has built-in support for HTML and Markdown. Our first public release focused on [Repla Server](https://repla.app/plugins/server/) , a solution that makes it easy to run a local web server that always refreshes. The HTML and Markdown support is even easier to use: Just drag an HTML or Markdown file to Repla, and it automatically refreshes when the file, or a referenced asset, changes.

This continues our emphasis on Repla as a live updating canvas, where you can manipulate what you're working on in any other app, and always see your changes live in Repla.

Our website has been updated with a new page for [Plugins](https://repla.app/plugins/). Behind the scenes, support for [HTML](https://repla.app/plugins/html/), [Markdown](https://repla.app/plugins/markdown/), and [Server](https://repla.app/plugins/server/) are written as plugins. Stay tuned for more information on how the plugin system works, as well as new plugins, coming soon.

Thanks for reading, and until next time!
